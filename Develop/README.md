# The Password Generator JavaScript

This repository contains JavaScript code for a simple password generator. The code generates random passwords based on user preferences for password length and character types.

## How It Works

The `The-Password-Generator` file contains the JavaScript code responsible for the password generation process. Here's how it works:

1. Users click the "Generate Password" button on the web page.
2. Users are prompted to enter a desired password length (between 8 and 128 characters).
3. Users confirm which character types they want in the password (lowercase, uppercase, numeric, special characters).
4. The code constructs a character set based on user preferences.
5. Random characters are selected from the character set to build the final password.
6. The generated password is displayed on the web page
